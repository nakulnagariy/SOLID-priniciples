# SOLID principle

SOLID is an acronym that stands for five principles of object-oriented design that are used to guide software development. The SOLID principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin in the early 2000s as a set of guidelines to help developers build more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software systems. The five SOLID principles are:

[**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**](Single%20Responsibility%20Principle/README.md)
- A class should have only one reason to change. This means that a class should have only one responsibility or concern, and any changes to that responsibility should only affect that class.

[**Open-Closed Principle (OCP):**](Open-Closed%20Principle/README.md)
- Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that it should be possible to add new functionality to a system without modifying the existing code.

[**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**](Liskov%20Substitution%20Principle/README.md)
- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. This means that objects of a derived class should be able to be used in place of objects of the base class without causing unexpected behavior.

[**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**](Interface%20Segregation%20Principle/README.md)
- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means that interfaces should be designed to be specific to the needs of the client and not contain unnecessary methods.

[**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**](Dependency%20Inversion%20Principle/README.md)
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This means that modules should depend on interfaces or abstract classes, not on concrete classes.

These principles provide guidelines for designing software that is maintainable, flexible, and scalable. By following these principles, developers can build software that is easy to modify and extend, and that is less prone to bugs and errors.
